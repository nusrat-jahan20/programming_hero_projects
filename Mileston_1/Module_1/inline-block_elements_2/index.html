    <h2>Block Elements</h2>
    <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    <br>
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

    <div>
        <p>Two commonly used block elements are: p tag and div tag.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p>An inline element does not start on a new line.
    <br>
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

    <p> <span> Span tag is a inline element.</span></p>

    <h2>DIV tag and SPAN tag</h2>
    <div>The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.</div>
    <span>The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.</span>
